Starling-freeSize
=================

Sample Starling app that handles all screen sizes and shows how to use multi sized assets. App will auto fit to screen size with letterbox and then adjust to fit width or height wise leaving you with a predictable work area and managable extra padding.

Inspired by Sam Hellawell's blogpost about handling multiple screen resolutions in Starling - http://samhellawell.co.uk/post/63226234372/multi-resolution-development-with-starling
